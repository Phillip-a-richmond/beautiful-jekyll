When you finally manage to get a manuscript draft to the point of completion, and you have secured your PI's valuable time for the final push, you start to feel the butterflies.  Butterflies about whether or not he'll like it, whether the editor will accept it, if the reviewers will tear it apart.  It's one thing being a co-author, (either second or buried middle author), where you really want/need the work to move forward. But it's another altogether when it's your own writing, your own voice, your own thoughts.    

Often times when writing scientifically it's difficult to remove the voice from your work. I want it to sound like I'm telling a story, as if the reader is engaged with me personally, they are in the same room with me while I explain myself. Years of practice and creative writing in school builds this voice, only to have the world of scientific writing strip it away. They butcher your beautiful and amorphous structure, put hard caps on your vocabulary, and strip away all the fluff. It has to be clean, simple, straightforward. The reasoning why is obvious, but the result is so dry.  

They should make a scientific journal where publications read with passion and emotion, truly detailing the arduous journey of ups and downs, failed experiments and insignificant results. Of writing code that has a single hidden bug you don't identify until you're making figures for publication. Of the hours you spent reading other's work to see if your years of effort produced something truly novel. 

Hopefully they do.
