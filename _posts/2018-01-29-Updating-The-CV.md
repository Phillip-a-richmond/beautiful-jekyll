So it seems you have found your way to my website somehow. And perhaps you want to know about a bit more about me, like how I look on paper. 

Just kidding, I didn't do this for the random people of the internet, I did this for my comprehensive exam committee. So it turns out that they need a CV, something that shows I have actually accomplished something in the past 2.5 years. 

And I have to say, updating the CV can either be akin to pulling hairs with hot wax (yes I have experienced this once), or it can be a very rewarding and fulfilling task. On this occasion, it was rewarding and fulfilling. 

I decided to scrap the old hacked together word document that I made in 2015, and instead turned to LaTeX. I don't know much about LaTeX, and after this experience, I truly have witnessed the power and beauty of explicit formatting. I do not comprehend much of it, but I took an Academic CV template (filled out for Albert Einstein actually) from [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/). This website is pretty awesome, as it has an online editor + compiler, which you can even work on collaboratively and backup to GitHub or Dropbox. 

For now, I won't fork over the $9/month for the collab abilities (google docs + paperpile is fine for that), but I sure do love what this website offers for personal use (free no collabs).

Anyways, if you want to see the final product hop over to the About Me section and find the link of the PDF.

Drop me a line if you want to chat about the stuff I do, find my email at the bottom of the main page.

Cheers for now,
Whomever may be listening,
Or perhaps I just enjoy self-documenting,

-Phil
