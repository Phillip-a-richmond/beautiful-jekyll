> Started from the bottom now we're here.

I decided to create myself a website, and after seeing Shaun Jackman's website I scrolled down and found this lovely beautiful-jekyll theme. I thought to myself, there is no single location that links my online presence, and I really don't have much control over the feel of many social media platforms. Sure they are fancy, and I'll link to them here, but I want a place where I can keep my work, my play, my thoughts, perhaps even some of my jokes? It's going to be an adventure, but it has to start somewhere.  

I also think that in my first attempt to make this post I put it into the Jekyll theme.  Oh shit...  


Signing off,
