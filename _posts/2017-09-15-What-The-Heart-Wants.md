> It's about to get a little bit personal.  Is it wrong to post something like this on a quasi-professional website? Maybe.  Am I going to do it anyways? Yup.



Everyone is out there either looking for love, or lost within it    
Some say 'Find someone who is the opposite of you, and you'll be more well-rounded'    
Others say find someone who is just like you, two peas in a pod    
Some may look to God for guidance, and there is nothing wrong with that   
Everyone wants it, and in today's day and age everyone wants it to be perfect  

But what is perfect love?    
Is it a warm fuzzy feeling of safety?  
Or is it more of a burning and fiery desire?  
Is it something that grows over time and must be nurtured?  
But how long does it take to know when you've found it?  

The gut feeling from deep deep down  
Analyzing the pros and cons  
Feeling lost without them  
Calculating a future trajectory  
Wishing it was more straightforward  

When do you decide to let it go?  
Should you make a hard break or leave it open?  
Who's advice should you go trust?  
To be analytical or have faith in emotions?  
Does writing sappy poetry help?  

Maybe  
Most likely not  
But capturing emotions is difficult  
Fireflies on a summer night  
But brighter and faster  

The Ride.  

You wait in line for an eternity  
Anticipating the thrill about to ensue  
When you finally board you wish it will never end  
The roller coaster doesn't slow  
It's up and down  
Changing from second to second  
Go back to her  
Hard turn left  
Find another  
Drop in free fall  
Calculate the rest of the ride  
Begins to climb  
Tingling feeling  
Around again  
Dizzy now  
Do not fear  
Ride will run again  
Same ride or another  
If you are up for it  
Getting off leaves you in vertigo  
Boarding again does not feel right  
Maybe it takes a few rides  
Different rides  
Some slower  
Enjoying the scenery and feeling comfortable  
Others a straight drop  
Get accustomed to one  
Ride it over and over  
Problem is knowing how long the ride lasts  
Impossible to project  
Just get on anyways  
Bother exploring?  
That is the question.
