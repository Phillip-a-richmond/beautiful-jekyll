### General Stuff

My name is Phillip Andrew Richmond, but I go by Phil.  

- I love dogs, genomics, bioinformatics, most organized sports (both playing and watching), lifting weights, and Vancouver BC.
- I currently have a beard
- I also have a passion for teaching.
- ***Decent at making lists***

### Research
#### Current
- Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders
  - Clinical grade copy number variant calling
  - Noncoding variant identification
- DNA elements responsible for X Chromosome inactivation 
- Teaching methodologies for introduction to genomics with an audience of life scientists
- Ty1 retrotransposon insertion profiling and mechanism in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* wild type and mutant strains
